crud -> just point it a db and it should generate an admin gui for it???
first iteration maybe create templates, import jsx components and hook up actions
crud conventions (model name, etc for url)


https://github.com/ianfabs/nanoid



store -> inited with table name?
methods receives dto or id, opts which fields to include + side load relations
have paging

common methods, findBy, all, create (upsert), update, delete, softDelete, fuzzy search

not soft delete with flags, instead use a cloned _trash table to store deleted items
simplifies usage, other queries don't have to care about it

service validates  (superstruct)

define models
define validations
json config


pre-built jsx components for crud stuff, eg tables, cards, forms


filtering interface -> cascading filters -> list of matches

how to compose filtering -> lists -> details -> forms ?


write many descriptive comments


--------------

tests -  some small apps to develop & test out the concepts
 --> damos or pages?

list options like synology storage manager (table vs cards)
